# ADAHP installation resources and tutorials
When experts make group decision-making in the analytic hierarchy process, the calculation steps are cumbersome, and the amount of repeated calculation is huge. When the consistency adjustment of the judgment matrix that fails the consistency test is carried out, due to the complexity of the method, the adjustment method is difficult to promote. This research designs an automated interactive system for AHP calculation and consistency adjustment based on MATLAB, and integrates four judgment matrix consistency adjustment methods (including GAOHP), which can intuitively, conveniently and quickly realize the calculation of analytic hierarchy process and the consistency adjustment of judgment matrix.<br>
